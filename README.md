Smart Supply Chain & Inventory Tracking System

The Smart Supply Chain & Inventory Tracking System is a Salesforce-based solution designed to streamline inventory, order, and shipment management for businesses. Traditional supply chain operations face challenges such as stockouts, overstocking, delayed shipments, and lack of real-time visibility, which lead to inefficiencies and customer dissatisfaction.

This project leverages Salesforce CRM capabilities (Admin + Developer) to build a centralized system where:

Products, warehouses, and inventory are tracked in real time.

Orders automatically reduce inventory, with low-stock alerts triggering reorder requests.

Suppliers are notified instantly, and delivery agents can update shipment statuses.

Dashboards and reports provide warehouse managers with complete visibility into operations.

Automation, Apex triggers, Lightning Web Components (LWC), and integrations ensure smooth workflows and secure role-based access.


The solution is lightweight, customizable, and scalableâ€”making it ideal for small to medium businesses seeking a smart alternative to costly ERP systems.
